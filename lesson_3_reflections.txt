When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	You would most likely use a remote repository when working with a team of programmers. This way, everyone has access to the files and all changes are updated and available to everyone. This keeps the changes uniform and consistent. Also, for solo projects, you can access files and apply changes from anywhere if your not at your home computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually gives you more control. You might not want to update the changes automatically for every file and project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are new projects based on an existing project which keep the working changes out of the main project, but still has a connection to that project allowing you to pull down changes. Cloning creates a local copy of a GitHub project on your local computer, but you cannot pull down changes like forking. A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.
